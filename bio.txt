Hello everyone, my name is Justin Dacquel. I am actively pursing the Application Development track at a program called Year Up.
In 2016, after graduating college, I figured out the business degree I obtained was no longer applicable to the profession I wanted to achieve. 
I postposed my education by working in retail as well as the medical field. While working in both of those fields I gained communication, conflict resolution  and rapid decision-making skills. 
I aspire to become a Front-End UX/UI Developer for a big coporate company. I value meanigful relationships and look forward to connecting with you all. :)
